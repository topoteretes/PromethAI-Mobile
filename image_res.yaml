# The organizer recursively looks into all files in the `asset_folder_path` (relative to the project's root)
asset_folder_path: assets/images/

# The organizer only arranges files with their extension listed in the `file_extensions`.
file_extensions:
  - .jpg
  - .png

# The organizer uses `resolution_indicator` to extract a resolution's part from the filename.
# The `resolution_indicator` must conform to the following pattern:
#   '[start_token]{N}[end_token]' where
#       - [start_token]: A token that indicates a starting point of the resolution's part.
#       - [end_token]: A token that indicates an ending point of the resolution's part.
#
# Valid `resolution_indicator`s along with example filenames that they can detect are shown below.
#   '@{N}x': logo@2x.png, logo@2.0x.png, @2.0xlogo.png
#   '--{N}#': logo--2#.png, logo--2.0#.png, --2.0#logo.png
resolution_indicator: '@{N}x'

# If `allow_overwrite` is true, when there is the same filename already existing in a target folder, the organizer will replace it.
allow_overwrite: false
